## 1. Assumptions

What works for an organisation of 20, 500 and 10,000 is very different. Most of these conventions assumes chat members of over 100. And built on experiences of members size of over 1000.

Most of the conventions are aimed at Slack workspaces. BUt also works with Microsoft Teams, Hipchat, etc. Others like IRC, Discord, etc are slightly similar.

These are conventions and not rules. Suggestions but not never to be adjusted laws.

## 2. Kill the General

In Slack there is a General channel. Once you have enough members of your workspace this channel gets busy and noisy.

With general chat about random news hat really belong in #random. To people chasing their favourite mug, or anyone with a specific bank fob thing. Or selling 2nd hand items, or about social gatherings at a specific office, which is annoying in a company with many locations.

Kill it. It is too ambiguous. For tiny workspaces it is fine otherwise just noise.

Enterprise Slack has had the option to rename this channel. Do it. I would suggest "Announcements".

I would also police this channel to only be official company announcements to prevent noise. And hardly even use it for that.
